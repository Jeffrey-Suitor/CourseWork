# Lecture 30

You start with a smaller input and when you feature extraction the information you have blows up in size. Afterwards you classify

Usually you need to do some enhancing before running over data

convolution -> reduction (polling, reduction layers)

Recurrent neural networks carry output neurons to the next generation for training

$(x^k, y^k)$

$\begin{matrix} good \\ cylinder \\ etc \end{matrix}$

Worked well in fourier due to crank shaft sensor (hall with one tooth missing)
