# Intro + Hypothesis

subpendymal zone (SEZ):
* Generates olfactory interneurons 
* Generates callosal oligodendrocytes
* glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Nestin expressing multipoential astrocytes with rather long cell cycles (B cells) appear to act as neural stem cells. (NCSs)

Activated B cells can be isolated and grown in culture as neurospheres with mitogens epidermial growth factor (EFG) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and they can renew and differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and ogliodendrocytes.

It is important for stem cells that they can reproduce.  Self renewal is regulated by cell-extrinsic signals, produced within endogenous stem cell niches with transcription factors that maintain cell development and modulators of the cell cycle are particularly important.

SOX are a type of transcription factor with Sox1, 2, 3, being expressed i most neural stem/progenitor cells and play a role in mataining undifferentiated state.

SOX2 in particular is required for adults NSCs. Reduction in SOX2 results in a loss of GFAP positive progenitor cells and deficient neurogenesis in the murine hippocampus and SOX2 hemizygosity in humans associates with neurological phenotypes and hippocampal malformation. 

SOX2 expression is high in gliomas and SOX2 silencing in glioblastoma tumour-initiating cells reduces their proliferation. Despite all this very little is known about the control of SOX2 expression in adults NSCs.

Showed that p21 directly binds to the Sox2 regulatory region.
Loss of p21 results in increased sox2 leading to replication stress.
Modulation of sox2 levels by p21 could be a regulatory mechanism to control the proliferation of NSC populations in the adult brain.
